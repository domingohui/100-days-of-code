# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: First day of 100 days of code! Finally got back to working on my cue_card app, which was suposed to be finished long ago... Fixed up some old ReactJS code.

**Thoughts:** I'm new to webdev. I was going to build the cue_card in Django only. But I want to learn about front end using ReactJS too. So I'll be using that to build the front end and Django just for a REST api for now. I will (hopefully) also be doing the ReactJS tutorial at the same time!
